      <h2>MISCHIEF MANAGED!</h2>
      <h3>What the Fish? Mar 11 2022 15:31 IST</h3>
      <p>Some decades from now, if any fisherman catches robotics fish, it would be no wonder, obviously not if robotic fish has already been taught to avoid traps or nets by default.</p>
      <h3>When you don't have any work to do... Mar 11 2022 07:52 IST</h3>
      <p>Well we all have dreams and to fulfill them, there is definitely something we can do today, that too in a scheduled manner.</p>
      <h3>Their memory shall live forever... Mar 10 2022 06:30 IST</h3>
      <p>At 03:30 today, one of my mommy's uncles have passed away.</p>
      <h3>Waking up @04:30 IST... Mar 09 2022 05:43 IST</h3>
      <p>We all have feeling of waking up early in the morning @ 4:30 ... Washing our face, brushing our teeth & getting to our work! Physical activity is much important for setting us in the loop. And obviously, beverages like tea help too.</p>
      <h3>Do you enjoy waiting? How? Mar 03 2022 09:14 IST</h3>
      <p>We all have that one awesome friend named <a href="https://google.com">Google</a>, a search engine using which we can search for information which we wish from all over the world. So, nowadays I was most fed up mindlessly imagining my future fate & wanted inputs on how can I stick to my present fate. And <a href = "https://www.jackcanfield.com/blog/staying-in-the-present-moment/">this page</a> really helped. Give it a read & share with me, how you enjoy your waiting time?</p>
      <h3>What are your thoughts occupied with? Mar 02 2022 18:43 IST</h3>
      <p>Isn't it so that our thoughts are occupied by somebody or something? For instance, I was thinking about 132 year teacher I recently met; earlier I met Him when I was young & this time when I entered His room, He was too occupied with His thoughts. And, we don't know whether it's Almighty Father with whom we are talking or it's just our own thoughts buzzing in head. Well! Blogging does help giving outlet to that unwanted buzz of thoughts. Writing them on paper too helps! So, what's your way of escaping that redundant, unwanted buzzing of thoughts?
      <h3>Got due opportunity... Mar 02 2022 17:45 IST</h3>
      <p>Wassup? We all have times when after being patient for long, praying for long, we get that opportunity to get the game on! Yesterday, around same time, I got that opportunity to learn computer science concepts and engineering stuff. Let me take you back to 2018, when times were not so good for me. I tried learning computer science concepts and engineering stuff but I messed up my class notes and pretty much I wasn't enthusiastic enough to learn computer science concepts and engineering stuff. Then, in 2019, I assumed the role of STEAM Trainer at Kaabil kids, where I worked for 16 months. After that, I again did home tutions & prepared alongside with my messed up notes and failed again. So, the important thing of that fresh start was again missing. 2018,2019,2020,2021... I shred them all here. What matters to me now is 2022! What's your opportunity story?</p>
      <h3>Robotics In Space... Feb 27 2022 21:39 IST</h3>

      <p>These days I have been daydreaming of working with Robotics in space. Robotics in space is primarily of two types:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Microgravity Robotics</li>
        <li>Planetary Robotics</li>
      </ol>
      <h3>How does the bootstrap program look like? Feb 24 2022 09:56 IST</h3>
      <p><a href="https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E19048-01/chorus4/806-0615/6j9v61fut/index.html">Answer</a></p>
      <h3>Bedtime Thoughts... Feb 20 2022 21:57 IST</h3>
      <p>Idea is to take challenge comprehending computer science and engineering with the help of projects of the same discipline available in the world. For example, asking self that how divide and conquer algorithm works and how and when and where to implement it?</p>
      <h3>Wu Assassin... Feb 20 2022 21:31 IST</h3>
      <p>After effects of watching this movie was being influenced and feeling being Wu Assassin. Also credits scene reminded me of my visits to beaches, especially that of Havelock Islands, a part of Andaman & Nicobar Islands.</p>
      <h3>Unfinished Business... Feb 20 2022 20:33 IST</h3>
      <p>Other day, I was watching this movie named "Fistful of Vengeance" and I left it in between. Let me complete it now!</p>
      <h3>One Fine Evening... Feb 20 2022 20:03 IST</h3>
      <p>So, here am I, connecting dots in the past, discovering identities & leveraging all knowledge that comes along with those identities. In domain of Big Data, many breakthroughs are ocurring but when it comes to cheap and specific data engineering Hadoop is not going to be obselete in the near future.</p>
