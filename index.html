                Making a match between the mind and the (computer) world.<a href="">

                You all would be aware that the mind controls the sense of sight, sound & touch (for abstract purposes). Computer (World) comprises of hardware & software. In layman terms, hardware is the stuff that we can touch while software is the stuff we cannot touch. (Have you ever touched instructions/thoughts?). But if it cannot be touched, "Software Engineer" needs to leave his/her job which is not the case. You can currently view my github page because Github has hosted it which is connected to you through internet whose primary purpose is resource sharing. People use to do a lot of math and that is prone to error, so they thought to make a machine that helps them doing the calculations for them. Set of instructions given to this machine, not initially automatic was termed as a program & it begun calculations. For every task/calculation, there was a program (set of instructions) that was given to machine. Later on, such methods were developed that made machine capable of accepting more than one programs & perform more than one tasks/calculations. Let's say you upload a photo on Facebook; it's nothing more than a line of code for Software Engineers at Facebook & sequence of signals for the computer which feeds on electricity. Program is practical while Algorithm is its theory. Algorithm is a set of finite steps taken in order to do a task/calculation; it existed before computers. Then algorithms were wrote by mathematicians for mathematicians & now are being written by mathematicians for computers.
