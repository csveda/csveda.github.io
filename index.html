      <h2>MISCHIEF MANAGED!</h2>
      <h3>When you don't have any work to do... Mar 11 2022 07:52 IST</h3>
      <p>Well we all have dreams and to fulfill them, there is definitely something we can do today, that too in a scheduled manner.</p>
      <h3>Their memory shall live forever... Mar 10 2022 06:30 IST</h3>
      <p>At 03:30 today, one of my mommy's uncles have passed away.</p>
      <h3>Waking up @04:30 IST... Mar 09 2022 05:43 IST</h3>
      <p>We all have feeling of waking up early in the morning @ 4:30 ... Washing our face, brushing our teeth & getting to our work! Physical activity is much important for setting us in the loop. And obviously, beverages like tea help too.</p>
      <h3>Do you enjoy waiting? How? Mar 03 2022 09:14 IST</h3>
      <p>We all have that one awesome friend named <a href="https://google.com">Google</a>, a search engine using which we can search for information which we wish from all over the world. So, nowadays I was most fed up mindlessly imagining my future fate & wanted inputs on how can I stick to my present fate. And <a href = "https://www.jackcanfield.com/blog/staying-in-the-present-moment/">this page</a> really helped. Give it a read & share with me, how you enjoy your waiting time?</p>
      <h3>What are your thoughts occupied with? Mar 02 2022 18:43 IST</h3>
      <p>Isn't it so that our thoughts are occupied by somebody or something? For instance, I was thinking about 132 year teacher I recently met; earlier I met Him when I was young & this time when I entered His room, He was too occupied with His thoughts. And, we don't know whether it's Almighty Father with whom we are talking or it's just our own thoughts buzzing in head. Well! Blogging does help giving outlet to that unwanted buzz of thoughts. Writing them on paper too helps! So, what's your way of escaping that redundant, unwanted buzzing of thoughts?

      <h3>One Fine Evening... Feb 20 2022 20:03 IST</h3>
      <p>So, here am I, connecting dots in the past, discovering identities & leveraging all knowledge that comes along with those identities. In domain of Big Data, many breakthroughs are ocurring but when it comes to cheap and specific data engineering Hadoop is not going to be obselete in the near future.</p>
